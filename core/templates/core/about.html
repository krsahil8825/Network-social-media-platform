            <p class="mt-3 text-justify">
                <strong>Network</strong> is a simple social media website where users can post text-based content, 
                share their thoughts, comment on other posts, and edit or manage their own posts.  
                The platform is designed to encourage open communication and meaningful interactions 
                within a clean, distraction-free environment.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                Our goal is to create a lightweight and easy-to-use platform focused purely on text 
                and ideas — no unnecessary noise, just genuine conversations.
